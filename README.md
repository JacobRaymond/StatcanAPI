# Statistics-Canada-API

Statistics Canada has published a series of API tools for development: https://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/developers.  

This project was an attempt at leveraging the API to automate some processes within ISED, notably the development of time series decks for analytical purposes.

"API Example" contains a tutorial I developed for educational purposes. Autotrend code is the code to update the aforementioned deck. ISED BrandOverview and Vectors.csv, meanwhile, are necessary templates whose purpose is explained in the code documentation. Finally, "a-novel-paradigm (...)" is a presentation I gave at ISED's Ottawa office.
